# CARYON
Correction And RecoverY of N-dimensional movies

While cryo-EM with modern direct electron detectors has proven incredibly powerful, becoming a dominant technique in structural biology, the analysis of cryo-EM images is significantly complicated by their exceptionally low signal-to-noise ratio, which limits the accuracy of the parameterisation of the physical models required for successful classification and reconstruction.
Micrographs from modern direct electron detectors are typically collected as dose-fractionated multi-frame movies to allow the recording of separated individual electron impacts. These detectors improve electron detection and allow for both inter-frame motion correction and dose-dependent image filtering, lessening the overall impact of effects deleterious to the recovery of high-resolution information.
In this study we show that, as well as correction for motion and radiation damage, the use of the information within movies through the comparison of subsets of frames allows substantially improved direct estimation of the remaining key image parameters required for accurate 3D reconstruction: the image CTF and spectral SNR, both globally and locally within the image.
We have developed “CARYON” as a LAFTER-family filter for cryo-EM movies based upon such measurements. CARYON is intended to provide high-quality parameter estimation and filtration for a single complete movie micrograph, or large sub-section from such a micrograph, without the use of previously reconstructed and refined single-particle or sub-tomogram density to provide a reference signal. We demonstrate its utility in both single-particle and tomographic cryo-EM data processing.
